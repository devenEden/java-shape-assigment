# Shapes Assignment Code Repository

This repository contains the code for a Shapes Assignment project. The project is implemented in Java and consists of a command-line interface that prompts the user to select a shape (circle, square, or rectangle), enter the shape's dimensions, and then calculates and displays the shape's area and perimeter.

## How to Use

To use the program, simply run the index class. You will be prompted to select a shape and enter the relevant dimensions. Once you have entered the necessary information, the program will calculate and display the area and perimeter of the selected shape.

## Files

The following files are included in this repository:

`index.java`: This file contains the main method that runs the program. It includes methods for calculating the area and perimeter of each shape, as well as a switch statement that determines which shape to create based on the user's input.

`Shape.java`: This is an abstract class that defines the methods that each shape subclass must implement.

`Circle.java`: This class extends Shape and defines the properties and methods for a circle.

`Square.java`: This class extends Shape and defines the properties and methods for a square.

`Rectangle`.java: This class extends Shape and defines the properties and methods for a rectangle.

`Posn.java`: This class defines a simple Posn class to store the position of each shape.
